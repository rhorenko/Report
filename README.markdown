Report
=====================

Report is a simple  Warehouse Management System for Android devices.

MPFlipTransition is a set of classes to add page-flipping transitions to iOS 5 projects.

I built it using ARC (and for the demo portion storyboards) strictly for convenience, so it uses iOS 5.  I imagine the relevant code (minus the UIStoryboardSegue helper classes) could be easily ported to iOS 4.3 under ARC, or ported to iOS 4.0 with memory management inserted.  (_Hint:_ If you're porting to non-ARC, you'll need to retain [sourceView superView] in the init method.)

Features
---------
* Simle and easy data entry.
* Query by categories - objects, materials, works (I can edit categories - just email me).
* Small and fast SQLite database.
* Exporting your reports to .txt files (maybe in future - cvs, pdf,xls). 
* Stability.
* Work fine for tablets.
* Sorting by date - maybe in future.
* If you have any troubles or need version for your device - just email me. I create it and pulish to Google Play.
